# CockpitApp

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Environment Configuration

The application uses environment files for configuration. These files are located in the `src/environments/` directory:

```
src/environments/
â”œâ”€â”€ environment.ts         # Development environment settings
â””â”€â”€ environment.prod.ts    # Production environment settings
```

To configure environment-specific variables:

1. Open the relevant environment file
2. Modify the environment object with your settings:

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/api', // Add your environment variables here
};
```

When building for production, the CLI will automatically use the production environment file:

```bash
ng build --configuration production
```

## API Types System

This project includes a comprehensive OpenAPI types system that provides type-safe API integration across applications. The system automatically generates TypeScript interfaces from the OpenAPI specification and organizes them into domain-specific libraries.

### ðŸ“š Type Libraries

The project includes specialized type libraries organized by domain.

### ðŸ”§ Available Scripts

#### Core Type Management

```bash
# Generate types from OpenAPI specification
npm run generate:types

# Generate types in watch mode (for development)
npm run generate:types:watch

# Force regeneration of all types
npm run generate:types:force

# Build all type libraries
npm run build:types

# Complete type update pipeline (generate + build + verify)
npm run update:types
```

#### Quality Assurance & Testing

```bash
# Run comprehensive type generation tests
npm run test:types

# Check for API drift (changes in OpenAPI spec)
npm run check:drift

# View type documentation
npm run docs:types
```

### ðŸ”„ Automated Workflows

#### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/api-types.yml
- name: Check API Drift
  run: npm run check:drift

- name: Update Types if Needed
  run: npm run update:types
```

The type system includes automated drift detection for CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/api-types.yml
- name: Check API Drift
  run: npm run check:drift

- name: Update Types if Needed
  run: npm run update:types

- name: Validate Type Coverage
  run: npm run verify:types
```

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the Vitest.

````

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
````

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
